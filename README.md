## About me
Hello there, I'm Unity Developer with 3+ years of commercial experience creating midcore and hardcore applications for both mobile and PC platforms. I have worked in teams ranging of 3 to 30 members and led small sub-teams of 3–5 developers. Throughout my career, I have developed scalable gameplay and rendering systems, built internal tools and contributed to performance-critical components ensuring stable operation under heavy runtime load. My technical expertise centers on performance optimization with strong skills in multithreading, shader programming and data-oriented approaches.

I see games as a modern form of art — capable of combining storytelling, interactivity, sound, and visuals into a unique emotional experience. This belief fuels my dedication to game development and drives me to approach each project with both engineering precision and creative intent.

## My Games Review
Over the years of working with Unity, I’ve developed a deep passion for game development. I've always been inspired by a wide range of games — from iconic indie titles to ambitious AAA projects. Exploring their mechanics, visual styles, and emotional impact sparked countless ideas and pushed me to create my own experiences. In my spare time, I’ve built several personal projects — small but meaningful games where I experimented with gameplay concepts, visuals, and technical challenges.

Below, I’d like to share some of these projects — each one a step forward in my journey as a game developer.

### Fate Dice

Fate Dice is a personal experiment where I set out to merge tactical combat with the unpredictability of dice rolls — drawing inspiration from games like Slice & Dice. My goal was to create battles that felt both strategic and chaotic, where each decision was influenced by luck, yet still rewarded planning.

Outside of combat, I aimed to design a broader gameplay loop reminiscent of Heroes of Might and Magic: exploring a world map, accepting quests, and managing resources. The result is a hybrid experience that blends turn-based tactics, RPG elements, and procedural randomness — all wrapped into a compact prototype built in my spare time.

### Tales of Destiny

Tales of Destiny is a card-based roguelike inspired by Hand of Fate. In this project, I explored narrative-driven progression through a dynamic board of hidden cards. The player moves step by step across a randomized grid, revealing events as they go.

Each card represents an encounter — a choice, a challenge, or a reward — and the player must make decisions that shape their journey. The goal was to blend light deck-building mechanics with storytelling and exploration, creating a system where every run feels unique and unpredictable.

Based on the outcome of the event, the player may enter a tactical autobattle, where their army faces off against enemy forces. The combat system was inspired by Warcraft 3’s approach to damage types and armor classes.

This project allowed me to experiment with procedural content generation, event scripting, and interactive storytelling — all within a compact gameplay loop.

### Pirates Crew

Pirates Crew is a 2D platformer adventure where you take on the role of a daring pirate exploring the mysteries of a lost island in search of long-forgotten treasure.

The island is filled with ancient puzzles, hidden passages, and deadly traps that challenge the player's logic and reflexes. But solving puzzles isn’t the only danger — the surrounding waters are teeming with hostile sea creatures ready to tear apart any foreigner who dares to disturb their domain.

This project was my playground for experimenting with level design, environmental storytelling, and physics-based puzzles, all wrapped in a lighthearted pirate theme. It combines exploration, problem-solving, and action to deliver a compact yet rich platforming experience.
